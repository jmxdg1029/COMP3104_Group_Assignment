DevOps is a crucial field that every IT professional must be knowledgeable about in order to succeed in their careers.  It can be difficult to understand just what exactly the role of a DevOps Engineer is from the surface because it is a continuously expanding field.  One thing that is for certain however is the fact that it was developed to fill the need for organizing cloud infrastructure in multi-tenant environments. 

Another reason it was created was to establish a connection between the software development teams and the IT operations. For this reason one of the key aspects of being a DevOps engineer is to communicate with your team.  By communicating with both the software developers and IT specialists, you can ensure that all their needs are met, and make compromises when their objectives clash.  

Instead of working directly with end users the way an IT professional might, DevOps engineers tend to work with other personel within their organization such as QC personnel, project managers, and project stakeholders.  To be a successful DevOps engineer, one must be experienced in using integration and automation technologies, and have a sound background in cloud coding languages.
