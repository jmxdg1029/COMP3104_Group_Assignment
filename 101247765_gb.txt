This file will contain information about George Brown college.

Balancing work, home and education is easy at George Brown with full-time, part-time and continuing education programs to suit your availability and allowing you to work towards a diploma, degree or certificate.

George Brown College established in 1967, Canada’s centennial year, Bill Davis, then the Ontario Minister of Education, suggested that George Brown College would be a suitable name for the new college of applied arts and technology.

George Brown College opened its doors in 1968, welcoming just over 2,000 students. In addition to programs in construction, early childhood education, dental services and the culinary arts subjects we continue to teach we once offered programs that might not be quite as relevant today, like signwriting and watchmaking.

Since 2004, under current President Anne Sado’s leadership, George Brown has more than doubled in size, broadened our international partnerships and increased our commitment to strengthening the cultural, economic and social fabric of Toronto.
