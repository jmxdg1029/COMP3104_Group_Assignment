DevOps culture brings the cohesion of autonomous teams to fast paced, high-demanding environments. 
It has a set of processes that when applied correctly can:
	1. Drastically reduce IT overhead
	2. Remove manual tasks both of a mundane or complex nature
	3. Enforce best security practices
	4. Expedite product delivery
	5. Improve communication and collaboration across teams

When a developer is working on a project which involves writing code, it is critical 
to ensure that all changes are tracked for both a historical context and the ability 
to rewind should development go south. Being aggressive with your Version 
Control System helps keep the introduction of bugs to a minimum and allows for 
an easy transition back to a stable state without potentially loosing hours of work.

A DevOps engineer can yield a great deal of power and provide a safe environment 
for developers to work in when a well-thought-out version control strategy is in 
place. Weâ€™ll be looking at some commonly used strategies, the problems they solve 
and the puzzle piece version control fills when developing a robust build pipeline 
to ensure deliverables are shipped with little risk.
